#Hub Hack Materials

**Hub Hack: Beauty & Personal Care + Future of Voice Hackathon**



Welcome to the Hub Hack September 2018! As you're hacking and developing your products, we'd like to give you some resources that will help your team along.



**Sponsor Resources** - We're lucky to have a few partners for this event who have made the below tools available for use. Thank you to Jetson and AWS for your generous support! 

##Jetson API

Jetson's developer friendly API / SDK enables automated searching, convenient commerce, and intelligent recommendations for a frictionless buying experience. Jetson's API builds contextual and cognitive awareness over time through machine learning and provides a continuous conversation with end users over time. 

[Jetson API](http://www.jetsonai.com/api-doc-beta/) - Jetson's API docs allow you to quickly utilize the Jetson product and do the following:

**API Features**

- Create your account with Jetson
- Create a product catalog json file
- Upload the product catalog to the server
- Get the product catalog
- Update or Delete the product catalog from the server

**Product Catalog Features**

- Order from that catalog using Jetson’s App through voice. 
- Order from that catalog using Jetson’s Google Home application
- Order from that catalog using their own application (built during the hack day) by just calling the API. 

For additional help, please ask a member of the Jetson Team or an event organizer.



##Amazon Web Services

**AWS Credits -**

Amazon Web Services has provided credits for developers to use AWS cloud services to build during Hub Hack. If you’d like to use AWS services, we can provide a $50 credit to each team to start building. 

Just ask one of the Hub Hack event staff or mentors, and we’ll give you a credit.

Once you have credit, you can activate it by doing the following:
