**Tips For An Effective Presentation**

- **Visuals are key**. Though the Hub Hack challenge is to provide a digital experience without the use of screens, illustrating and communicating the vision will help your audience and the judges understand your solution. 
- **Props and prototypes are encouraged**, but not mandatory. If you can demonstrate a working version of your solution, good for you! But if you can walk through the vision without a working prototype, you won’t lose points for it.
- **Fake it**. You don’t have to design your product end to end, you just need to highlight the important parts. For instance, if you wanted to demonstrate a voice capability, you could play back a recording for the judges during your presentation.
- **Decide who presents**. It could be one person, or the entire group, but be ready for someone to take the mic and present your solution!

For additional questions, please ask an event organizer.

## What The Judges Are Looking For

The most important thing is for your team to sufficiently develop a solution to the Hub Hack challenge. Judges will be assessing your proposed solution based on the following equally-valued criteria: 

1. **Ambition Of The Problem**
   - Scale and complexity of the problem being explored. 
2. **Innovation Of The Solution**
   - Scale and novelty of the technology being used, and/or the approach taken.
3. **Potential Impact**
   - Total impact of solution, assuming the solution is effective. 
4. **Quality of Presentation**
   - Ability for the judges to clearly understand the desired solution. Team showed thorough research and considerations in their presentation.
